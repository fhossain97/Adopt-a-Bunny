# Adopt-a-Bunny

**Adopt-A-Bunny** is a animal-shelter inspired website where users are able to adopt rabbits. Users can submit rabbits for adoption and be able to edit, delete, and update their rabbit's information. 

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User is able to view list of available rabbits for adoption
- [x] User can submit rabbits for adoption by creating a new request
- [x] User can login and logout to the website using their google credentials
- [x] User can request to adopt any rabbit of their choice

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User is able to upload and edit an image

Further development ideas:

1. Display user's username on the website once logged in
2. Have an option for creating an account if google credentials are not used
3. Users will be recommended animal shelters in their area
